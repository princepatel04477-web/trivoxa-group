/**
 * Shape registry for the home-page particle field.
 *
 * The scene builds only the shapes its choreography names. Home happens to
 * name all of them, so this saves nothing today — the laziness exists so a
 * second choreography can be added without every page paying to sample every
 * shape (each builder runs a MeshSurfaceSampler, and the globe additionally
 * oversamples tens of thousands of Fibonacci points through a point-in-polygon
 * test against the continent rings).
 *
 * A per-page shape vocabulary was designed and prototyped for the Group,
 * Businesses, Insights and Careers pages; it was dropped because those pages
 * already carry bespoke GLSL shader backgrounds (see ShaderBackground and
 * src/shaders), which occupy the same fixed z-index:-1 layer and already give
 * each page its own visual identity. The design work is preserved in
 * docs/research/ANIMATION_CHOREOGRAPHY.md.
